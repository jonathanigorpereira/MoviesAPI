# MoviesAPI
This is a simple api developed in Alura's course on .NET 6 technology.
</br>
This api is intended for the study of .NET 6 technology, in order to reinforce the concepts and later study and apply concepts of design Patterns,
asynchronism, performance and EntityFramework.

Until now I learn about REST Patterns and more about API development using .NET 6, where I created a fake datas within Lists and searching this datas using Linq.
</br>
I learned to do exceptions notification natives and parameters to do datas required and I used interfaces actions to do rest returns.
